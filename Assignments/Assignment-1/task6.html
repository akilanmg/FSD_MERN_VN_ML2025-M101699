                As global awareness of environmental issues grows, sustainable technology has become a

                One of the most promising areas is renewable energy, where advancements in solar, wind,
                and hydroelectric power systems are making clean energy more affordable and accessible
                than ever before. These technologies not only help mitigate climate change but also
                create new economic opportunities.
